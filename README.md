## Installation

### From source 

This project uses [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage dependencies. Clone the repository
and use `uv` within the repository directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lrvdijk/flamino
cd flamino
uv run python  # Or any other command
```

### Running the Jupyter notebooks locally

To run the notebooks locally, it is recommended to install a project-specific IPython kernel and keep Jupyter installed
in a separate uv environment, as per the [uv documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/jupyter/#using-jupyter-within-a-project):

```bash
uv sync
uv run ipython kernel install --user --env VIRTUAL_ENV $(pwd)/.venv --name=flamino
uv run --with jupyter jupyter lab
```
